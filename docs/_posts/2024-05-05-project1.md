I've been meaning to create my own website at some point and finally got a weekend to work on it, now that my semester is over. It is so easy nowadays to do it for free using GitHub Pages and Static Site Generators.

The first thing I'll do it to highlight some of my projects in different posts as I reflect back on some things I have developed or created for fun or for work.
