It turns out that I had unintentionally plagiarized the original name of my website, "Jack of all trades, master of some," from a friend who had it on his profile nearly 7 years ago from today. In my head, I had come up with it from scratch because I consider myself a jack of all trades, but I am fairly proficient in some areas (master of *some*).

I got to thinking and came up with "The Generalist Papers" as a little play on the Federalist Papers back in the day. I later sought ChatGPT's assistance in brainstorming some other ideas but didn't have too much luck. "A Generalist's Journey" was just a bit too plain and didn't have that side-meaning or relatively obscure reference that those of the Reddit/neckbeard community would appreciate and enjoy.

For those that are on the confident stubborn end of the spectrum like me, let this be a reminder to take a moment to step back and consider the big-picture view of situations. Especially in relationships, it's very important to understand your biases and your audience/partner's predispositions regarding communication and attachment styles.

> “Know the enemy and know yourself; in a hundred battles you will never be in peril. When you are ignorant of the enemy, but know yourself, your chances of winning or losing are equal. If ignorant both of your enemy and yourself, you are certain in every battle to be in peril.” - Sun Tzu, The Art of War

Not that relationships are (always) a battle/war, but self-awareness and awareness of your partner's tendencies will go a long way in ensuring fewer misunderstanding, miscommunications, and misinterpretations. Lastly, be kind to each other. Your family, friends, and partner deserve at the minimum the same amount of respect and compassion you give to your coworkers and strangers.
